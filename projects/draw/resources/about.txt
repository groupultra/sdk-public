Play with AI and humans! Try to let AI draw something for you or guess what others draw!
Vision Model: gpt-4-vision-preview
Image Generation Model: dall-e-3

Usage:

- Send "draw [something]" to let AI draw something. For example, you can send "draw banana".
The thing you draw would be up to others' guesses.
If others' conversation contains your "something" word (correct guess!), the word will be shown as <b>[REDACTED]</b>.

- Chat with others to guess what AI is drawing. If you guess correctly, I would let you know!

- Click "Ask AI" to let AI anaylze the picture and guess what it is.

- Clear "About" to see this help message again.

Have fun!
