This is the source code of the Cicada Service run on channel 372386d6-8435-4e76-b8d1-8fe18d3da323.

The code is functional but shitty (though refactored twice). Beginners are not recommended to read this code.

The code requires a valid OpenAI API Key configured in your environment variable. Please see https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=python
