Welcome to the Moobius SDK
===================================

**Moobius** is a group-driven social interaction platform which resembles Discord but has more features and flexibility.

This library is the open-source SDK for building CCS apps. These apps interface with the Platform and allow your computer (or a cloud instance) to have full awareness and control as to who is joinded and which users see what content.

Don't worry about network configuration! The included Demo in the Github (`<https://github.com/groupultra/sdk-public>`) needs nothing more than your Moobius account credentials and the id of a Moobius channel you created in the browser.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

.. note::

   This project is out of Beta but is still under active development.
