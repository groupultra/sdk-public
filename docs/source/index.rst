Welcome to the Moobius SDK
===============================================================================================

**Moobius** is a group-driven social interaction platform which resembles Discord but has more features and flexibility.

This library is the open-source SDK for building CCS apps. These apps interface with the Platform and allow your computer (or a cloud instance) to have full awareness and control as to who is joinded and which users see what content.

Don't worry about network configuration! The included Demo in the `public Github repo <https://github.com/groupultra/sdk-public>`_ needs nothing more than your Moobius account credentials and the ID of a Moobius channel you created in the browser.
